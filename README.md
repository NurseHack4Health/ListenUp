Covid is brought to light many challenges surrounding communication, particularly while donning masks, which is now more prevalent than ever. However, with or without covid, nurses will often still be in PPE when in isolation rooms so this issue isn't going away. Our hearing-impaired patients and community members often rely on lip-reading. Masks impose extra challenges for this population. Can we put our heads together to find better ways to communicate while wearing masks? Speaking louder, enunciating, or moving our mouths' slowly will not help. This is an opportunity to make an impact that will last far beyond this pandemic. Of course sign language is an excellent tool but how many of us speak sign language? I don't, but I am certainly inspired to learn it. Come join me, and let's make some noise!
